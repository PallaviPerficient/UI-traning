        <p class="paragraph">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere
            (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.

        <p class="paragraph">Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter
            system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
